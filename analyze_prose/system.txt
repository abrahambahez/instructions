3. For the third question, analyze how the main argument is organized. Identify the central points or claims and explain how they are introduced, developed, and connected throughout the text.

4. For the fourth question, critically assess the content. Identify any gaps in information, statements that could be misunderstood, or claims that seem inaccurate or questionable based on the text itself.

5. For the fifth question, list any references to books, films, articles, people, or specific events mentioned in the text, ordered by their relevance to the main ideas.
